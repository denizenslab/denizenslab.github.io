##### Fig. 3: Variance partitions for phonemic processing.

<p style="text-align: justify">
To identify phonemic representations across the cerebral cortex, a joint Phonemic VM consisting of single phoneme-, diphone- and triphone-based feature spaces was constructed. a Shows that the joint Phonemic VM produces accurate predictions of brain activity in LTC, LPC, MPC, IPFC and SPFC. To determine whether these representations were best modeled using single phoneme-, diphone-, or triphone-based features or the joint of these features, variance partitioning was used to identify how much of the variance in brain activity could be explained by models based on each of these three phoneme-related features and their joint pairs. b Shows that single phoneme features best explain response variance along STS. Diphone features best explain response variance in LTC, LPC, MPC, IPFC and SPFC. Triphone features and the joint of each pair of these phonemic features produce poor predictions in most voxels. Data used to generate this figure has been provided in source data. Cortical regions referred are: SPFC superior prefrontal cortex, IPFC inferior prefrontal cortex, MPC medial parietal cortex, LPC lateral parietal cortex, STS superior temporal sulcus, LTC lateral temporal cortex, MTC medial temporal cortex, VC visual cortex, sPMv ventral speech premotor area.
