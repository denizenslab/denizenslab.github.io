description: Denizens are interested in understanding how complex information is encoded in the brain and in artificial neural networks. We use machine-learning approaches to fit computational models to large-scale brain data acquired during natural tasks (e.g. reading a book, listening to a story, real-world conversations, watching a movie) and study the correspondence between artificial neural network representations and brain representations. Currently, we explore how more than one language can coexist in the human brain. Below, you can find our publications, by categories, in reversed chronological order.
