Our group’s goal is to deepen the connection between artificial intelligence, data science, and neuroscience in research and teaching. We develop computational models of human brain responses that were acquired under ecologically valid conditions. By exploring language representation, communication, and cognition in biological and artificial systems, we aim to enhance our understanding of the neural and computational bases of brain processes under ecologically valid conditions. We thereby aim to understand and optimize artificial neural language models by integrating insights from brain research to ultimately expand both the explainability of artificial systems and our understanding of the human brain.
